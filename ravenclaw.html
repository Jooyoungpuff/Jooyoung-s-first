<h2>Ravenclaw에 대해서</h2>
<br><a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%9E%98%EB%B2%88%ED%81%B4%EB%A1%9C" target="_blank" title="namuwiki">Ravenclaw is the house</a> which most values the virtues of <strong>wit, <u>wisdom</u> and learning.</strong>
<p>Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was a medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal is symbol is an eagle, and blue and bronze are its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw is Filius Flitwick and the house ghost is the Grey Lady, otherwise known as Helena Ravenclaw. </p>

The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires.</p>
